* Twitter to Blog
:PROPERTIES:
:LOGGING: nil
:END:
** Premise
Twitter has so much information hidden in it's threads, but navigating them by topic is somewhat hard.

This is my attempt at using Twitter's API to convert a user's account into a essentially a blog
** Plan
  Overall, the plan is to do all the tweet data processing in python, and store data in elasticsearc, and serve results using react
*** Barebones [1/3]
**** TODO Python to manage tweet data [2/2]
***** DONE Algo to get main thread tweets
***** DONE Make Titles of Threads keywords (find with spacy)
**** TODO Elasticsearch to store data and query [2/3]
***** DONE Figure out schema
***** DONE save json data with python
***** NEXT load data with JS
**** TODO React to display Webpage [0/7]
***** NEXT display threads
***** NEXT Display threads per user
***** TODO display each thread in its own page
***** TODO Link each tweet to original page
***** TODO display each thread in a clean card
***** TODO Figure out nice UI
***** TODO Sort threads 

*** Future
**** TODO make spacy phrase finding cleaner by getting rid of numbers and common phrases
**** TODO add engagement metrics, and display best threads at top
***** other options for thread display, sort by newest, oldest, longest, shortest, most famous
** Storing data schemas
*** DB of user
store user id, keywords from all threads,

*** DB of threads
needs to be elasticsearch for speed
each thread will have user id, text, keywords
