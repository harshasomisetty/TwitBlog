* Twitter to Blog
:PROPERTIES:
:LOGGING: nil
:END:
** Premise
Twitter has so much information hidden in it's threads, but navigating them by topic is somewhat hard.

This is my attempt at using Twitter's API to convert a user's account into a essentially a blog, done with MERN stack

** Plan
*** Steps
**** UI
***** TODO Overall Theme
***** TODO Each thread in new card
***** TODO Sort author threads by engagement
***** TODO Main page lists highly engaged tweets in past with user bio, main tweet, keywords
***** TODO author page with stats (number of threads, keywords and interests), and cards of all threads by topics
****** TODO Link to podcasts
**** Data
***** TODO Naval how to get rich no keywords bug
***** TODO Expand links
***** TODO Auto Update Twitter data
***** TODO get rid of numbers
** Other notes
Used [[https://blog.patricktriest.com/text-search-docker-elasticsearch/][this vue and elastic tutorial]] and [[https://blog.logrocket.com/full-text-search-with-node-js-and-elasticsearch-on-docker/][this other tutorial]] to help figure out the MERN stack

For refactoring the app after solidifying my stack, I used [[https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-and-dockerize-a-full-stack-react-app-with-nodejs-and-nginx/][this]] link. Also, [[https://tiangolo.medium.com/react-in-docker-with-nginx-built-with-multi-stage-docker-builds-including-testing-8cc49d6ec305][this link]] help directly build the app and push into nginx

for making a database globally available, found express app.locals from [[I foun][here]]

[[https://github.com/fireship-io/tailwind-dashboard/blob/main/src/index.css][This]] was amazing reference while figuring out tailwind
