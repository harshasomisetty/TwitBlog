* Twitter to Blog
** Premise
Twitter has so much information hidden in it's threads, but navigating them by topic is somewhat hard.

This is my attempt at using Twitter's API to convert a user's account into a essentially a blog


** Plan [0/3]
- [ ] Python to manage tweet data
  - [ ] Algo to get main thread tweets
  - [ ] Get informative user replies, and main account replies to these replies
  - [ ] Topic Modeling Based Search
- [ ] MongoDB to store data
  - [ ] Python connection
- [ ] React to display Webpage
  - [ ] UI for choosing users
  - [ ] figure out tailwind css for theme

  Overall, the plan is to do all the tweet data processing in python, and store data in mongo db, and serve results using flask
  then react connects to flask and makes it look nice

** JSON Outline
plan is to store each thread into schema
#+begin_src javascript
  const schema = {
      author: { type: 'keyword'},
      title: { type: 'keyword'}, // keywords of thread
      tweet_ids: {type: list},
      text: {type: 'text'}
  
#+end_src
