## Other notes

Used [this vue and elastic tutorial](https://blog.patricktriest.com/text-search-docker-elasticsearch/) and [this other tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/full-text-search-with-node-js-and-elasticsearch-on-docker/) to help figure out the MERN stack

For refactoring the app after solidifying my stack, I used [this](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-and-dockerize-a-full-stack-react-app-with-nodejs-and-nginx/) link. Also, [this link](https://tiangolo.medium.com/react-in-docker-with-nginx-built-with-multi-stage-docker-builds-including-testing-8cc49d6ec305) help directly build the app and push into nginx

[This](https://github.com/fireship-io/tailwind-dashboard/blob/main/src/index.css) was amazing reference while figuring out tailwind
