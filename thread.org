Meanwhile, in India...we're seeing a free market renaissance?

"...privatizing state-owned enterprises...overhauling taxes, relaxing foreign direct investment rules and deregulating labor and agriculture markets."

As I've said, I am only moderately bullish on the Indian state. As the saying goes, India disappoints both the optimists and the pessimists.

But there is a dark horse chance that by 2030 it's the *least bad* of the big three relative to China and the US.

It's important to remember how long a period a decade is. Ten years ago, Bitcoin was at $1. A lot can change.

An achievable vision for India may turn out to be that it is a reasonable home base *and* more friendly to emigrants than either the US or PRC.

We talk about immigration policy, but emigration policy is as important. Do you let people exit freely? Do you let them make fortunes abroad, coming &amp; going as they wish? And is your diplomacy good enough to permit your citizens to enter other states?

Sometimes you can screw everything up but just nail one feature. India has PIO cards, which allow people to come back as they want. It lets citizens leave, doesn't harass them abroad, and isn't aggressive towards other states.

Passport needs work, though!

The right to exit is a foundational right, arguably *the* foundational right, and part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Why is the right to exit the most important right, even more important than the right to vote?

Because many countries call themselves democratic ("Democratic People's Republic of Korea"). Or feign fair elections, like the USSR.

But they're prison states.

This used to be a pillar of US foreign policy, by the way. Jackson-Vanik penalized the USSR for trying to charge Soviet Jews huge fees to leave.
